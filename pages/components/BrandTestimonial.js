                                <p className="mb-5 pt-2">Pine Book Writing did a good job on printing and delivering copies of my book of poetry written in Russian. They did it expeditiously and in promised time, actually, a bit faster. The quality of the paper used and printing was quite adequate. Ryan Peters, the publication manager, was very approachable, friendly, and quick to reply to my requests and questions. Dealing with Damon, the owner, was a good experience as well.</p>

They helped walk me through the process step by step. Whenever I needed to talk with them, they made time for me. We had a big project, and they helped me finish it. My time spent with Pine Book Publishing produced results. They helped me finish my project and for that I am very thankful.

The writer displayed a deep understanding of the subject matter and articulated it coherently. The turnaround time was quite reasonable, and they were receptive to my inputs. With just a few proofreading hiccups, their service proved to be commendable, and I'm pleased with the final result.

Everyone is helpful and care about you, your ideas, and how hard you've worked with your manuscript. Steve, Lia, Ryan, and David go beyond their job. They deserve a raise. I recommend Pine books for all your writing needs.
